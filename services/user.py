# In the services/user.py module, we define a UserService class that encapsulates the business logic for user-related operations. The class has methods
# for creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting users. The UserService class interacts with the UserRepository class to perform database operations.
# The UserRepository class is responsible for interacting with the database to perform CRUD operations on the User model.
# The UserService class provides a layer of abstraction between the API routes and the database operations. This separation of concerns helps keep the
# codebase organized and maintainable. The UserService class can be easily tested and extended without affecting the API routes or the database
# operations. The UserService class follows the single responsibility principle by encapsulating user-related business logic in a separate class.
# The UserService class provides a clean and consistent interface for interacting with user data. The methods in the UserService class are self-contained
# and can be reused across different parts of the application. The UserService class follows best practices for structuring business logic in a FastAPI
# application. The separation of concerns between the API routes, services, and repositories helps maintain a clean and modular codebase. The UserService
# class can be easily extended or modified without affecting the rest of the application. The UserService class follows
# the dependency injection pattern by accepting a database session as a parameter in its constructor. This allows the class to be easily tested with
# different database configurations or mock objects. The UserService class provides a clear separation between the business logic and the database
